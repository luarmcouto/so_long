# So_long-42 üëæ
<h3>What is So_long ‚ÅâÔ∏è</h3>
The So_long project at 42 is a practical introduction to 2D game development and the use of the MiniLibX graphical library. The goal is to create a small game with simple mechanics where the player must traverse a map, collect items, avoid obstacles, and reach the exit to win. This project teaches fundamental concepts of graphical rendering, event handling, and game logic.

<h3>Key points üîë</h3>

**Map Handling**
- The map is represented by a .ber file and must follow a specific format containing walls, collectible items, empty spaces, the player's starting point, and the exit.

**Graphical Rendering**
- Uses MiniLibX to display the map, sprites, and animations. This includes frame-by-frame rendering and efficient window management.

**Event and Movement Handling**
- Captures events such as key presses to move the character across the map and interact with the environment.

**Resource Management**
- Handles proper memory allocation and deallocation, as well as graceful game termination when specific conditions are met or in case of errors.

<h3>Conclusion ‚úÖ</h3>
In summary, so_long is a practical introduction to 2D game development and graphical libraries in C. It allows students to consolidate their knowledge of event handling, game logic, and resource management while building a fun and interactive application.
